<p><center><b>Notice to Candidates</b></center></p>
<p><center><b>Online Timed Assessment - 2022</b></center></p>

<p>Your online timed assessments in 2022 will be delivered via the VLE. The past papers available on your programme Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) continue to be a good revision resource, whether you are being assessed for the first time this year or have sat previously.</p>

<p>Depending on your programme, there may be some minor differences to ensure that assessment remains fair, valid and reliable under these alternative conditions. That may mean, for example, changes to the number of questions you will be asked to answer, the way those questions are asked or the amount of time you have to answer them. There will also be arrangements in place to detect and respond to instances where candidates break the rules for assessment.</p>

<p>We have developed a <a href="https://d28lyjfgvs18xy.cloudfront.net/exam_support/prepare-for-your-online-assessments/content/index.html#/l"><u>short online course</u></a> to help you prepare for your assessments.</p>

<p><b>In addition to this general notice and the rules for online timed assessment, you should carefully read the additional programme guidance below, follow any paper-specific instructions issued to you and consult the <a href="https://london.ac.uk/current-students/programme-documents/regulations"><u>General Regulations</u></a> on Online Timed Assessment.</b></p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Accessing your assessment</u></p>

<p>• Your Admission Notice contains your candidate number and lists the assessments that you are registered for. Your candidate number is important. Please make sure that you have it available when you are submitting your completed assessment.</p>

<p>• The dates on which your assessments will become available will be quoted on page one of this notice. If you are required to start your assessments at a particular time, this will also be quoted.</p>

<p>• Take advantage of any practice sessions offered by your programme to go through the assessment process, and make sure you are able to access the VLE now. It may take us several days to resolve any issues you might have. If you have any access issues, please log a query under 'Ask a question’ on your <a href="https://my.london.ac.uk/login"><u>portal homepage</u></a> as soon as possible using the 'Online Assessment’ category.</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Completing your assessment</u></p>

<p>• From the time the assessment is released, you will have a set amount of time to upload your completed answers. This time period is stated in the programme-specific information at the end of this notice and will also be confirmed when you access your assessment.</p>

<p>• You are asked to complete the assessment within the specified time given in the assessment question paper and use any remaining time to submit your answer.</p>

<p>• You do not need to remain online as you write your answers unless this is specified in your assessment instructions.</p>

<p>• Work submitted for assessment must be entirely your own.</p>

<p>• For assessments with a word limit, this is a maximum and not the amount you should write.</p>

<p>• Do not upload rough work unless your assessment instructions tell you to.</p>

<p>• You must follow the rules for online timed assessment listed below (Rules for Online Timed Assessments). Please read these carefully. Breaking any of these rules may result in an allegation of assessment offence.</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Submitting your assessment</u></p>

<p>• Ensure that your candidate number, paper code and paper title are included within all submitted files. Do not include your name anywhere in the file you submit. Your candidate number will be used to identify you during the marking process.</p>

<p>• You should submit your work as files in the format specified in the programme-specific information towards the end of this notice.</p>

<p>• If your paper requires you to handwrite certain sections (for example, to complete diagrams or mathematical formulae) you will need to photograph these with your mobile device/scanner and include them with your typed answers.</p>

<p>• If you have a special examination arrangement in place that allows you to submit a completely handwritten script you will need to photograph your work with a mobile device/scanner and submit it in the same way through the VLE.</p>

<p>• You must submit your answers by the deadlines we have set and in line with our <a href="https://my.london.ac.uk/documents/10197/80507983/Online+Submission+Policy.pdf/87c44bb9-d062-6268-628f-27268067ba64?t=1617007452742"><u>Online Submission Policy</u></a>. Failure to submit your answers by the deadlines may result in a penalty or your work not being accepted.</p>

<p>• If we cannot open the files you have submitted, we will treat your submission as a valid attempt, and you will receive a mark of zero for the work concerned.</p>

<p>• If your file is blank we will treat your submission as a valid attempt and you will receive a mark of zero for the work concerned.</p>

<p>• We will mark the work you have submitted as it is. We will not permit you to submit a final draft of your work after the deadline.</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Mitigating circumstances, illness and other problems</u></p>

<p>• Mitigating circumstances are problems beyond your control, which generally occur without warning, and which may have negatively affected your performance in an assessment. If you are unwell or encounter problems which you believe have affected your performance, you should submit a query using the 'ask a question button’ on your <a href="https://my.london.ac.uk/login"><u>portal homepage</u></a>.</p>

<p>• You must write within <b>three weeks</b> of the date of your last online timed assessment including, where possible, a detailed medical report made at the time of the illness and/or other relevant evidence. Submissions received more than three weeks after your last assessment will not be considered.</p>

<p>• If the regulations for your programme state that by sitting an examination you are declaring yourself fit to do so, this will also apply to your online timed assessment. You should check your <a href="https://london.ac.uk/current-students/programme-documents/regulations"><u>Programme Regulations</u></a> carefully before you take the assessment.</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Inclusive practice and access arrangements</u></p>

<p>• If you already had access arrangements approved for the examinations, they may not all necessarily be applicable for the online examinations as the online format differs from the exam centre hand-written format.</p>

<p>• If you have a disability or medical condition and/or new access requirements resulting from the move to online timed assessments, please contact us as soon as possible and at least two weeks before your first assessment date. A panel will consider your request in line with the University’s 'Inclusive Practice Policy'.</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Marking process and publication of results</u></p>

<p>• The standard practice for confirmation of results and awards by the Board of Examiners will be in place for all online timed assessments.</p>

<p>• Assessment scripts will either be marked independently by two examiners, or moderated by a team of examiners, and confirmed by the Board of Examiners. There is no procedure to consider appeals against assessment results on academic grounds.</p>

<p>• You can apply for your results to be re-checked if you think there has been an administrative error. Details of this service will be available through the student portal when your results are released.</p>

<p>• Keep your Admission Notice safe as you will need your candidate number to access your results.<p>

<p><b>More detailed instructions, for example regarding technical aspects of the online timed assessment process, will be provided through the VLE in advance of, or at the time of, your online assessment.</b></p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Rules for Online Timed Assessments</u></p>

<p>If you break any of the following rules, your case may be considered under the assessment offence procedures. The University has processes in place, including the use of text-matching software, to aid the detection and investigation of potential assessment offences.</p>

<p><b>Important: These rules must be read alongside the additional programme-level guidance below. Your programme may modify or supplement individual rules for Online Timed Assessment for some or all assessments.</b></p>
  
<p>1. You must follow the General Regulations and all instructions given to you by the University in advance, and at the time of, your assessment.</p>

<p>2. You cannot take an assessment if you have not received an Admission Notice from us.</p>

<p>3. All work you submit for assessment must be your own, expressed in your own words and include your own ideas and judgements. By submitting work for assessment, you confirm that the work is entirely your own and has been completed on your own, without the assistance of others.</p>

<p>4. Submitting work which has been written by someone else at your request, either in full or in part, is contract cheating, which is prohibited. This remains the case whether you have made payment for this service or not.</p>

<p>5. You must keep to the rules set by your Programme regarding the use of additional materials, books, papers or instruments during your assessment.</p>

<p>6. Unless guided otherwise, if you make direct use of somebody else’s work, either by memorising it or copying it word-for-word from a source, these passages should be included within double quotation marks, with no spaces between the text and quotation marks. You should also include the details of where you have copied or memorised the material from in the following format (Author, Date).</p>

<p>e.g., "Sample Text" (University of London, 2022)</p>

<p>7. Unless guided otherwise, you should not submit work, in whole or part, which you have previously submitted for assessment or publication.</p>

<p>8. During the time an assessment is live you must not exchange information, or engage in any discussion, about the assessment in such a way that yourself or another student taking, or yet to take, the paper may be advantaged. This includes, but is not limited to, online discussions, verbal exchanges, video conferencing, screen-sharing, copying or allowing your work to be copied. If two or more students submit the same or similar pieces of work, all answer scripts will be referred for investigation and subject to penalties, if an offence is proven.</p>

<p>9. Where handwriting is permitted, or required, for your assessment your answers must be legible. You should write as clearly as possible. Only use dark ink (blue or black) on lightly coloured paper. If a submission is considered to be illegible by the Examiners, you may be awarded a mark of zero for that assessment, or part of the assessment. No answers will be transcribed.</p>

<p>10. You must type all of your answers in English, unless you are instructed otherwise.</p>

<p>11. Do not include your name anywhere in the file you submit, including the title.</p>

<p>12 You must adhere to the word count where one is given. Submitting work in excess of the total may result in work after that point not being marked, or the application of a penalty.</p>

<p>13. You must submit your answers by the deadlines we have set. Failure to submit your answers by the deadlines may result in the application of a penalty or your work not being accepted.</p>

<p class="att-ttl"><u>Further advice</u></p>

<p>• You are advised to thoroughly read the instructions provided to you when your assessment is released before you start writing.</p>

<p>• When you have completed your assessment, make sure you submit any additional components (e.g., rough work, notes, plans, calculations) if the question paper instructions require you to.</p>

<p>• All suspected assessment offences will be referred by the Board of Examiners and considered in line with the <i>Procedures for the Consideration of Allegations of Assessment Offence</i>.</p>

<p>• If you are the subject of an allegation, you will be contacted under the Procedures and asked to provide a statement. Your results will be withheld whilst investigations are ongoing.</p>

<p>• Proven offences are likely to result in a formal reprimand, the equivalent of a zero mark and the loss of a permitted attempt. Offences in future sessions are subject to escalated penalties, which include the equivalent of a zero mark for the full module or year.</p>

<p><i>University of London assessments are governed by the University's Regulations and Ordinances, Guidelines for Examinations, the Programme & General Regulations and this Notice.</i></p>

<p><b><u>Permitted Materials</u></b></p>

<p>You are permitted to use a calculator for the <b>CM1020 Discrete Mathematic, CM1025 Fundamentals of Computer Science and CM2025 Computer Security</b> online timed assessments only.</p>

<p>You may use any calculator for any appropriate calculations, including one on your computer. But you should note that in some cases, presenting your working might be required for full marks and using a calculator might not enable this.</p>

<p>You are permitted to access the internet during all online timed assessments, but all sources must be accurately referenced.</p>

<p>Some exams may require you to draw diagrams. We recommend that you install drawing software to create these drawings as neatly as possible. However, if this is not possible, you are permitted to draw diagrams by hand on light coloured paper using blue or black ink.</p>

<p><b><u>Referencing</p></b></u>

<p>The work you submit must be your own and expressed in your own words.</p>

<p>If you make use of the work of others, memorising or copying it word for word, this material should be included within double quotation marks, with no spaces between the text and quotation marks. You should also include the details of where you have copied or memorised the material from in the following format (Author, Date).</p>

<p>e.g.</p>
 
<p>"Sample Text" (University of London, 2021)</p>

<p>If you make use of the code of others, this will also need to be referenced. You should include the URL or other reference detailing where the code has come from.</p>

<p><b><u>Word Limit</u></b></p>

<p><b>For Section B a maximum of 7 pages for a word-processed submission and 10 pages for a hand-written submission is allowed. Examiners will not mark work which exceeds the specified page limits.</b></p>
 
<p>You should use a plain font such as Arial or Calibri and font size 11 or larger.</p> 
 
<p><b><u>Before the Day of the Assessment</u></b></p>

<p><b>Practising for your assessment</b></p>

<p>To ensure that you are prepared for your online timed assessment, we have organised a practice test for you in advance of your actual assessment. We strongly recommend that you complete a practice test before the date of your first assessment.</p>

<p>The practice test area will be available in the VLE from <b>12:00 GMT on Tuesday 1st March – 12:00 GMT on Friday 4th March</b>. You are asked to log in after 12:00 on 1st March to practise going through the online timed assessment process.</p>

<p>Log in to the University of London VLE now to familiarise yourself with the login procedure and layout of the VLE. Contact us immediately if you experience any problems logging in to the VLE.</p>

<p>Check in advance when <b>12:00 midday Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</b> will fall in your own local time zone. You can check your local time against Greenwich Mean Time at the <a href="https://time.is/"><u>time.is</u></a> website.</p>

<p><b><u>On the Day of the Assessment</u></b></p>

<p><b>Log in to the VLE at any time after the question paper release time.</b><br>
Use your Student Portal login details.</p>
 
<p><b>Download the question paper.</b><br>
Multiple Choice questions and question papers will be accessible from the course areas within the University of London VLE.</p>
 
<p><b>Work on your answers.</b><br>
You will type your answers offline for Section B of your online timed assessments.</p>
 
<p>Draw diagrams on light coloured paper using blue or black ink. Label diagrams clearly. Reference your diagrams in your typed answers. For example, ‘refer to the graph labelled Figure 1’.</p>
 
<p>Handwritten answers may be required for some quantitative papers. Use black or blue ink on light coloured paper for handwritten answers. Your work must be legible.</p>

<p>You will complete the Section A multiple choice questions by selecting answers directly in the VLE. You will need to remain online to complete this part of your assessment.</p>
 
<p><b>Save and submit your answers by the deadline.</b><br>
Submit your work as a Word document (.doc or .docx) unless we instruct you otherwise. If you do not have access to Microsoft Word, other word processing apps, including free online versions (Google Docs, Open Office, etc.) allow you to save or export as a Word file.</p>
 
<p>We will accept handwritten answers and diagrams in any file format, including pdf but examiners will not mark work that is illegible. For best results, use a scanning app such as MS Lens or Adobe Scan to create a pdf version of your work. Several scanning apps are available free of charge and will enable you to produce high quality images quickly and easily. You can also photograph your work and upload it through your mobile device.</p>   
 
<p><b><u>If you are unable to take the online timed assessment</u></b></p>

<p>If you do not take the online timed assessment, this will count as an attempt at the examination element of assessment for the module.</p>
 
<p>If you are unable to take the assessment due to mitigating circumstances, you must contact the University within three weeks of the scheduled date of your last online timed assessment. Further information on the University’s mitigating circumstance procedure can be found <a href="https://london.ac.uk/current-students/examinations/submitting-evidence-mitigating-circumstances">here</a>.</p>

<p>Instructions on what to do if you encounter problems during the assessments will be provided with the assessment questions.</p>
