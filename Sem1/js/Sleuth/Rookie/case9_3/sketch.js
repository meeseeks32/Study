Case 403 - Cornered - stage 3


We have Shiffman cornered at Algol fish whole-salers and more help is on the way.
Until our backup arrives the orders are to make sure he stays inside Algol fish whole-salers

Your job is to indicate that Shiffman (signified by the mouse) is indeed within the North - East - South - West bounds of Algol fish whole-salers.
Draw a GreenYellow rectangle covering Algol fish whole-salers for as long as Shiffman is in it.

Use X11 colours. You can find a reference table at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors.

There are many possible ways of investigating this case, but you
should use ONLY the following commands:

  if()
  fill()
  rect()
  mouseX
  mouseY

var img;

function preload()
{
	img = loadImage('map.jpg');
}

function setup()
{
	createCanvas(img.width,img.height);
}

function draw()
{
    // draw the image
    image(img,0,0);

    //Write your code below here ...
    
    if ((mouseX > 2624 && mouseX < 2794) &&
            (mouseY > 1076 && mouseY < 1202))
        {
            fill(173, 255, 47);
            rect(2624, 1076, 170, 126);
        }
    
//    fill(255,0,0);
//    text('X:'+mouseX+' Y:'+mouseY, mouseX, mouseY);
    

    // finally, draw Shiffman's position
    strokeWeight(2);
    stroke(255);
    fill(255,0,0);
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 10, 10);
}
