The body did not obey, and with difficulty he brought his numb palms to his mouth in an awkward attempt to loosen the grip of the icy "jaws" with his breath. His lungs were burning, and his whole body seemed to be pierced with needles of frost. One exhalation, another, third ... - the limbs were still trembling involuntarily, but the pain pouring over them in a new wave indicated a returning sensitivity. The man turned his head sharply: “What was that? The sound of my pursuer footsteps? Or a frantic pounding of own heart drumming in your ears? " He involuntarily began to crawl to the side, in the direction of the sound source. </p>

Sprint towards the exit in one movement or try to get to the water? But the body was still poorly obedient and all escape routes were perfectly shot. Can I try to fight? Catch the enemy off guard by jumping out of cover and turn the tide of events with one precise blow? But he was not a skilled fighter and, in addition, lost his weapon in the last failed attack. Try to negotiate? Exit showing empty hands and appeal to the mind of the captive? But the latest attempt to stop the bloodshed only worsened his already dire situation. Surrender to the mercy of the winner? Perhaps a new figure who could speak a human language will be merciful and keep his promise? But it seems that the attackers only need his life</p>

The man spent another minute in silent reverie - in such silence he would definitely hear the movement of the enemy - "Perhaps the pursuer rushed for help?" But he remained alone and unarmed, and the sorceress's fighting spirit did not seem to fade away, even after the loss of most of his sisters at the hands of recent captives. Immobile, the guy spent a few more moments in silent concentration, but nothing happened. The ringing silence began to physically crush, and, in the end, Fanvor decided to carefully look out from behind the monolith, behind which he found salvation. Smooth movement: right - clear. With grim anticipation, he repeated the movement, looking over his left shoulder, but there was no one there either. "Am I really alone?" Refusing to believe in such a development of events, the fugitive, breathing deeply, began to slowly rise, carefully studying his surroundings.</p>
