                                                <p>It's hard for me to say how the phenomenon of rollboarding began and what games were first remade for it, I can only say how I got to know it myself. My first acquaintance with role-boarding as a board game was when I met the BSG Board Game, based on the Battlestar Galacticaseries .</p>

                                                <p>This game has many advantages for role-boarding - a well-known and rather interesting setting, fairly easily supported mechanics, team play and intrigue, it constantly keeps players in suspense, and most importantly, knowing the setting of the series, it is easy to describe the events taking place in the game with a very high level of detail ... I would say that BSG Roleboarding is much better than even the original series, as it allows you to create your own version of the plot in each module. This board also has some drawback - in the format of rollboarding, it is very, very long, ~ 47 moves (excluding the premature loss of a team of people), each of which consists of lengthy discussions, during rollboarding it can take six months or more of the game.</p>

The mechanic is based on throwing a set of dice and getting the number of successes necessary for solving the problem (dice on which 4 or more have dropped out). Initially, the set consists of one cube and can be increased by:</p>

                                                    - Tags are descriptors of skill subsections, such as "nimble" for a thief, or "dodge" for a pilot. If the action matches the skill, then you can select several tags that match the description of the action, and get +1 cube for each tag. <br>
                                                    - Personal set - each character receives 7 cubes at the beginning of the session, and can spend them to increase the set of cubes of a specific action - but if successful, the cubes are not returned to the personal set. <br>

You will be surprised, but losing in Fiasco is an interesting experience. Some people even like to die in Fiasco. How so? - you ask, and I will answer you - you will soon find out. So, we roughly imagine what the Fiasco game is about . Now it should be explained how it differs from any other role-playing game. </p>

In Fiasco, several players get together to create a story. There is no leader, no party, no movement towards a common goal. Even with a certain influence of the dice, it is the players who play the main role in shaping the plot.</p>

                                                <p>Our topic today is an interview with a famous person in the RPG world, Rob Donoghue. “Analyst, and at times game designer in the suburban jungle of Maryland,” as he describes himself in a blog post. RPG fans know him as one of the founders of Evil Hat productions, one of the authors of the FATE system for many years, who has put a lot of work into Margaret Weiss games, and Cortex Plus in particular (Leverage RPG and Smallville RPG), as well as many other products , great, and, more importantly, have left their mark on the history of the industry. Rob generously agreed to answer our questions, so, breaking off an already overgrown introduction, let's move on to the questions themselves</p>
                                            </div>

                                            <div class="col-xl-12 order-3">

                                                    First, about the situation. We, and at least some of our readers know you as a person who is currently at the center of the evolving RPG industry. As far as I can see, now the focus is shifting from such giants as WotC, White Wolf and others - to the "indie" sector, to games that a decade ago were not even sold but were sent for free, made by a small team with real goals, changing the very essence role-playing games as we know them. Can you agree with me? What projects in recent years - say, the last year, or this spring - are, in your opinion, the most important for the evolution of the gaming industry? Which ones influenced her the most?
                                                    <br><b>Rob Donoghue:</b> <br>
                                                    While you are right about the changes taking place in the industry, I think the situation is actually more complicated. The first thing you can forget about the big dances (I'm talking about the World of Darkness and DnD) - both WOTC and White Wolf have always tried to introduce new, interesting and experimental solutions. The fourth edition was not to everyone's liking, but it was done well and copes well with the tasks set. Of course, not everyone is interested in these tasks, but Wizards know what they are doing. Likewise, the White Wolves have done a great job developing adventures, developing publications in PDF, even in games they worked out a lot of interesting ideas.</p>

                                                <p>Ghosts of Albion is a curious thing. Not associated with various recognized brilliant designers, but connected with other interesting people, as well as with projects about which we somehow shamefully little is known (there is nothing about Unisystem even in Radagastopedia, for example).Let's start with the authors. The "Ghosts" were made by Amber Benson and Christofer Golden. Amber, who does not know - this is the whole Tara McLay. Well, Tara, that cool one from Buffy, Willow's girlfriend ... Damn, is Buffy such a gray-haired antiquity already? Is this how the glory of the world passes? In short, the Ghosts writer started out with a role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. </p>

                                                <p>This speaks of two things at once: the role in Buffy determined, it seems, a lot in the further creative path of Amber: what she did, with whom she did it, to whom she oriented her own creations. Second: Amber is a delightfully diverse talent. She plays in films, produces films, makes films, writes books, comics and, behold, role-playing games are a geek's dream, I think. Hang her portrait over your desk.</p>

The point is that we worked with the Georgian government and found a lot of sponsors for the project there, organized communities, and we cooperate with several companies there, so we know what to do and how. We plan to start with apps, and then sooner or later we will make a full-fledged MMO on “I am a zombie”. We plan to do absolutely everything.</p>

                                                <p>The Polish writer Maya Lydia Kossakowska takes Christian mythology and without any difficulty turns it into a heroic fantasy. Angels here, although they have power, are much closer to people than to the incomprehensible messengers of God. Their functions are numerous - from servicing the mechanisms of the Universe to protecting the world from the creations of the Anticreator, the Shadow of the Creator, which he once separated from his personality, leaving himself only positive qualities. </p>

In each of the camps, be it Heaven, Hell or Limbo, there are dozens of factions with their own ideals and goals. And some of them believe that it would be high time to carry out the zeroing of the existing order - maybe the Creator will return after the Last Judgment?</p>

But the decades of peace have come to an end - the immortal norns once again invade human lands, seeking revenge for past defeats.

At the same time, despite the abundance of events, "The Empire of Grass" cannot be called either hasty or chaotic, which could have happened if the book was written by a less skilled author. Williams finds the perfect pace for the story: not in a hurry, but at the same time always keeps the reader in suspense.</p>

But given the difficult financial situation in which the girl found herself, this is just a gift from heaven. True, the house where she settled had previously belonged to the Spiritualist Society.

Noise, voices, crying, creak of floorboards, a mattress unexpectedly sagging under an invisible body ... After one night in such a house, you need to run, but Stephanie has nowhere to run and nothing. And then it gets worse and worse. However, this story is not really about a haunted house. More precisely, not only about him. The ghosts of 82 are scary enough on their own, but the worst monsters are homeowner Drach McGwire and his cousin Fergal. These are not just scum of society, evil, uneducated and cruel, but real hardened criminals. If they don't like something, they easily turn to extortion and violence. They are described very realistically, and it is to them that we owe the most eerie scenes in the novel.</p>

The writer warned from the very beginning that fans would have to wait, but hardly anyone suspected that the wait would drag on for thirteen years. However, during this time, readers have already managed to get an idea of what awaits them on the pages of the "Shadow Portal" Since 2010, Cook has published new stories of the adventures of the Black Squad. And the fans realized that the writer was laying out the chapters of the new novel. Indeed, edited versions of three of the six published novellas have become part of the Shadow Portal.</p>

Kraevskaya skillfully combines elements of dark fantasy, pure horror and the ubiquitous Young Adult in her novel. What to do: A young heroine with special abilities, an important mission, a mysterious past and love interests swirling around her is actually a YA marker. And then the author correctly, accurately and clearly arranges the figures of the episodes on the chessboard of the plot - exactly so that the horror does not overshadow the love line, and Venda's youthful reflection did not allow us to forget that the nights are here dark and full of horrors.</p>

Apparently, young Venda, his student and adopted daughter, will have to do this. True, the situation for the new Guardian is not the best: horror and horror are activated, a little girl from the village prophesies about all evil, and a charismatic man-wolf begins to circle around Venda ...</p>
