                                In general, I love game books since childhood - it just so happened that the first edition of “The Age of Aquarius” and the book “The Mystery of Captain Shelton” by D. Braslavsky came to me almost simultaneously (the author of the book, by the way, is, according to him, a fan of creativity Dmitry Braslavsky, whose books-games became for him a guiding star among the book-game constellations in the fantasy sky on the way to achieving literary heights). Then there was "Michael Frost" and others. Therefore, a new, huge - the largest ever published - book-game from a Russian author aroused great interest in me. <br>So, what do we see in the book-game “The Entrance”? The book is huge - 1000 pages, 2460 paragraphs and over 150 illustrations. Inside we will find, first of all, a good, well-written fantasy setting (Yuri Kharlamov, the author of the game, is primarily known as a science fiction writer, and the World of the Dark Legendarium really appears to the player as alive). By the way, one of the crowdfunding rewards includes a collection of stories accompanying the game.</p>

The vaults of the hall, going to the top, formed a hemispherical dome ending in a round hole through which the mystical shine of the moon got inside. The walls were adorned with tiles folded into the scales of a giant sea creature and filled the entire room with a soft bluish-green glow reflected from the water's light. A wide, mosaic-decorated plaza led to the center of the room, crossing a massive gate (arch?) Of pearl color.

But after the victory, the guys never returned to normal life - there is the burden of world fame, and the feeling of guilt before the dead, and depression. However, ten years is a long time: it's time to let go of the past and breathe easy. Only here the anomalies, as it turns out, did not even think to disappear, which means that the Chosen will have to prepare for a new battle ... <br>The influence of magic on the modern world is described with fiction. The magic that has become commonplace has been reflected in various spheres of human life. Research began to be devoted to magic - excerpts from them are no less interesting than the main story. Fashion designers began to cut clothes that refer to the popular images of "wizards". The architecture we are accustomed to was replaced by buildings that do not obey the laws of physics. Magic has infiltrated literature, cinema, sports, even marketing. Of course, the power structures were also completely reorganized. But high technologies were abandoned as unnecessary, which more than once will serve as a loophole for protagonists accustomed to thinking "the old fashioned way."</p>

Pondering the situation, he looked around his surroundings and instantly regretted it. The adrenaline caused by a desperate struggle for survival dulled his senses and only now the man realized that he was surrounded by a heap of dead bodies - some of them still preserved their appearance and made it possible to identify the attackers, while others were formless masses of flesh. Instinctively, he backed away and took in a deep breath - the sickening smell immediately hit his nose, instantly causing dizziness. The grief of the fugitive stopped only after a moment, when the intelligent part of the brain suggested that these opponents were no longer dangerous. As if protecting the fragile psyche of its owner, the body almost erased the brightest pictures of what had happened from its memory, and now it again felt the horror that it had just experienced. And, although the reason still hesitated under the influence of the surrounding picture, the analytical part of consciousness noted the contrast in the nature of deaths.</p>

Other bodies, on the other hand, evoked the sensation of being in a slaughterhouse. Not a single stab wound, all opponents were chopped to pieces.

Fanfiction attracted the attention of fans of the original, and then a representative of the publishing house. In China, the book was published in 2011, and in 2019, after the cycle "Memories of the Earth's Past" thundered in the West, it was published in English. <br>Fanfiction, although it closes some gaps in the plot of the trilogy, feels detached from it in tone and main ideas. The most successful was the first part, where Baoshu complements the image of the trisolarians and organically develops the idea that aliens cannot lie. We will learn how the aliens planned their attack on Earth and what role Tianming played in this. Here the book resembles a good novelization of the film, showing what is left behind the scenes.</p>

And, although the temperature in the room was quite comfortable, his forehead was covered with perspiration. From top to bottom, he tried to wipe the sweat from his face and ward off bad memories, but felt something sticky on his palm. Examining his hand, Fanvor noticed the blood, and stared at it stupidly, trying to figure out what had happened. Coming out of the stupor, a moment later, the guy examined himself: by some miracle, he got out of this whole alteration with only a couple of scratches, unpleasant, but not at all dangerous. Directly in front of him, in the center of the room, there was a small depression filled with clear water. The altar, behind which the guy was hiding, was large enough to reliably hide it from the eyes of even those who could be on the second floor terrace, but the fear of being noticed still made him sprawl like a snake. Crawling carefully to the side, the man looked inside. For some reason, he was expecting something unusual, and for a few moments peered into the water, trying to see something in it. Perhaps there was nothing unusual there, or "something" simply did not deign him with its appearance and only sent his own frightened reflection towards him against the background of the pale disc of the moon. Then, the person slowly touched the surface - nothing happened, the reflection only flickered with faint ripples - and the liquid itself turned out to be cool to the touch. Having collected a little moisture in his hands, folded with a ladle, the man carefully sniffed it, and, making sure that it was ordinary water, he began to “wash”, wiping off the blood and sweat from himself.</p>
