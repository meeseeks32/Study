        <ul style="list-style-type: none">

                <h2>3)Introduction:</h2>
                <p>The main idea behind this website came to me when I was planning the next event for new members of our small group. <br>
                    Prior to this point, we used online messengers and voice chat software (mostly Discord) to communicate with each other. While this mode of communication has its advantages, it still lacked some key features. To find something in the chat, users had to scroll through the mass of unstructured information. Fanfics and news were mixed with the game sessions logs and off-topic conversations in one big mess of a channel. <br>
                    This website helped us to achieve 3 main goals: <br>
                    -	To create visually pleasing user experience for veterans and new members alike. <br>
                    -	To systemize and structure all information that we use in our hobby. <br>
                    -	To develop a virtual nexus that connects all members and keeps useful information and materials to improve the quality of life for all subgroups and community as a whole. <br>
                    For this site, I mostly used a simple linear sequence with small supporting digression for the first and second pages. Because this website covers a few different topics, pages are mostly autonomous and connected the only trough the navigation menu.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>4) State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website:</h2>
                <p>1.	https://www.rpg.net/ - one of the biggest role-playing hubs on the internet. It is also including a bunch of different related blocks - about books, games, and other resources. This resource is great, but it is created in the old-school style of the thematic forum and lacks visuals. I took the main idea from here, but decreased text and added more images, so new members do not get overwhelmed. <br>
                    2.	https://rpg-news.ru/ - Russian role-playing community newsletter. They consistently post fresh news and interviews with prominent figures from the fantasy world. I was inspired by their news page design and content structure. <br>
                    3.	Our own games and gatherings that inspired me and my friends, created the mood and the purpose for this website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>5) State 3 ways in which your site is accessible:</h2>
                <p>1.	Alternative text is added to all images, so it can be accessed by screen readers to describe an image, giving context to users who would otherwise miss it. <br>
                    2.	Special resource (https://colorscheme.ru/) is used to create a distinguished color pallet for this website. This scheme is clean, contrast and helps to ensure that all text and elements are standing out. <br>
                    3.	Forms used on this website are designed with accessibility in mind. Each form field is clearly labeled and supported with a sample placeholder to help people who a using a screen reader.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>6) State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site:</h2>
                <p>1.	Search - one of the main goals of the website is to create community and help to bring in new members. To allow new people to find this page it is especially important that they find your resource while browsing. To increase chances that they will stumble upon this resource I added more keywords and picked some special ones for the different pages. <br>
                    2.	Navigation - unfriendly navigation can ruin user experience even in other regards the website is great and thoughtful. Aside from the general navigation panel that helps users to surf across the pages, I decided to add local navigation panels on the "big" pages to safeguard users from the need to scroll for a long time just to reach the desired part. <br>
                    3.	Content - webpages that consist the vast amounts of text can be immensely helpful but not very handy to use. I think that even information pages should balance text and graphical content to create a pleasurable experience for the users. I tried to evade "walls" of text on this page and sprinkle some images to help with content consumption.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>7) State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that:</h2>
                <p>1.	I had to learn how to better structure content the hard way. While working on this site I changed the structure a few times to find a perfect (in my humble opinion ofc.) balance that would be informative, helpful, and easy to comprehend and navigate. To better understand I had to analyze more analogical websites and consult with my friends and like-minded people (stakeholders in this regard). <br>
                    2.	Also, I had to find out more about design. Early sketches that I produced were rejected by my friends, and we had to work together to create a pleasant experience for the visitors and doable job for the developer. Communication was a key concept I was forced to master, while working on this site. <br>
                    3.	I learned to better google things. While I started working using mostly bootstrap library, in progress, after we decided to add other new features besides news and articles, I had to "borrow" ideas and ways to implement them to my website. Thankfully, there is almost always some guidelines and readme files that give basic ideas about how to use some side libraries. In other instances, I used stack overflow to find some answers to my questions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>8) What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h2>
                <p>I pleased that my friends, the people who inspired me to create this resource in the first place, evaluated this site very high, and with some small minor tweaks, we almost certainly will use this project as our starting point. I think the main reason everything worked well as it did - because I have been very close and open with friends who tested this website. They helped me a great wat with everything starting from the feedback and opinions to even some content pieces and design ideas. I think while working on this site I evaded the main trap - I did not create a website for myself, but for people who will use it. For them, with them (I mean the stakeholders in this instance) - the best way to create a successful website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>9) What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h2>
                <p>There is always room for improvement. I think that this resource should have more pages. Maybe if I did this project again and had more time I would separate the game page into few smaller ones, but specialized them more and added some more little features: create different something akin to databases or tables with information about all players and their characters, maybe gallery for the map part. Or even add different games hub with more pages for different DnD campaigns, with subpages about campaign story, players, characters, etc. Also, I like to take my time to learn JS and add some additional interactivity - like login feature, forum pages that allow for communication, or maybe even on-line to talk with people without additional software.</p>
